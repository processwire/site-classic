# ProcessWire “Classic” installation profile

This is the the first installation profile ever developed for ProcessWire and 
it was the one released with ProcessWire 2.0 back in October of 2010. So it’s 
pretty old (the word “classic” is a nice way of saying that). It hasn't really 
changed since then, but it is still a good starting point, and it continues 
to work just fine even in the newest versions of ProcessWire. 

While this profile looks like an early 2000's website, the point is what’s behind
it, and it continues to serve as a very good example of the direct output strategy 
in ProcessWire. 

If you are just getting started with PW you may find this profile
to be very easy to digest and understand because there's not much to it. But if 
you are looking or more modern development techniques in ProcessWire then you
may want to instead check out the 
[Regular site profile](https://github.com/processwire/site-regular) or the 
[multi-language site profile](https://github.com/processwire/site-languages). 

## To install

Depending on your version of ProcessWire, you may already have this site profile
included with the core, in which case you do not need to download it. If you find
that you do not already have it, follow the instructions below: 

- To use this site profile, you must first have a copy of ProcessWire that has 
  not yet gone through the installation process. 

- Copy the files from this repository into a `/site-classic/` directory in your
  web root (or wherever ProcessWire’s `install.php` file is located). 

- Open the URL where you've copied ProcessWire's files to in your web browser. 
  The installer should start, and when it asks you what site profile you want to
  install, you should see this profile there. Select it and continue installation.
